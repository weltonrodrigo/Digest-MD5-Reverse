MD5 sums (see RFC 1321 - The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm) are used as a one-way
hash of data. Due to the nature of the formula used, it is impossible to reverse
it.

This module provides functions to search several online MD5 hashes database and
return the results (or return undefined if no match found).

We are not breaking security. We are however making it easier to lookup the
source of a MD5 sum.
